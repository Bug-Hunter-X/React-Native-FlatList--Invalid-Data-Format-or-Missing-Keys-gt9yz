# React Native FlatList Error: Invalid Data or Missing Keys

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native. The error occurs when providing an incorrectly formatted data array, specifically when the array contains non-object elements or when objects lack a unique `key` property.

## Problem

The `FlatList` component requires data to be an array of objects, where each object has a unique `key` property to identify its elements. Providing an array without keys or using other data types can lead to crashes or incorrect rendering.

## Solution

Ensure the data provided to `FlatList` adheres to the following structure:

1. The data prop must be an array.
2. Each element in the array must be an object.
3. Each object must have a unique `key` property.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation demonstrating how to provide properly formatted data to `FlatList`.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application on an emulator or physical device.
4. Observe the error in the `bug.js` file and the correct rendering in `bugSolution.js`.
